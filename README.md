Data Structures Final Project : Graphs
===

This project is about implementing Graphs, Weight Graphs, Directed Graphs and Weighted-Directed Graphs.

Main Requirements
---
* Read coordinate data from a file
* Assemble a graph from the data
* Use a traversal algorithm to find the best path for each case given
* Print out the best path for each case

| B1 Branch |
===
The 'B1' branch is being used to restructure the current assignment. New details came in. 

New Requirements
---
* Use inheritance to create all the graph classes
* Use the WDGraph to build a particular graph and find vertices that are adjacent to two vertices and find the shortest path from node 2 and node 4
* Use the DGraph to build a particular graph and find vertices that are adjacent to two vertices and find the shortest path from node 2 and node 4
* Use the Graph to build a particular graph and find vertices that are adjacent to two vertices and find the shortest path from node 2 and node 4 
* Each section must be presented with a header output for each section
